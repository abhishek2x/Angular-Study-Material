* Easy to use and similar to Angular Js Forms.
* Two way data binding with ngModel
* Buklky HTML and minimal component code.
* Automatically tracks the form and form elements state and validity.

## Drawbacks; 

* Unit testing is a challenge
* Readability decreases with complex forms and validations.

* Add the form HTML
* Binding data
* Tracking state and validity
* Providing visual feedback
* Displaying error messages
